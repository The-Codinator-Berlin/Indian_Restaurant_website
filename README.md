# Indian_Restaurant_website

This website is purely fictional. It is to have 4 pages linked together,
a map/contact info, some sort of table, radio inputs, form/texarea link 
for email that opens email app and some flexbox, terms and conditions, 
a picture and a navbar. 

I wasn't able to apply grid to this project but I applied some flexbox. 
It's still not perfect but I have managed to place some things on the page with it.
